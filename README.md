# OnlineMall
This project started out as a full E-commerce platform hence the name OnlineMall but later was narrowed down to only Stationery products. 
It is an online website for a Stationery store depicting all the various categories of products available as well as the products.

Users are allowed to create an Account with this site to acces some sections such as Orders, Cart, Notebox.

<h3>Orders</h3>
The fact that the platform allows users to browse through various products, they can as well place orders fro whatever products they want.
This would involve then filling a form with required details such as:<br>
*Phone number,<br> 
-their location,<br> 
-their preffered method of payment and<br>
-the Quantity 

<h3>Cart</h3>
Other than place an order, a user maybe be interested in a product but unable to purchase it at the momment. He/she can add these products to cart and keep track of them so that any time they are ready, they can easily access them and place the orders.

<h3>Reviews</h3>
Each product has a review section where any user can share their experience with the product so that other users can use these info to judge whether to go for  aproduct or not. It is super open and any user can share anything hower insignificant it may look about any product.

<h3>NoteBox</h3>
Much as this site is designer for purchases, the NoteBox comes in as an extra section within the ite where user get to log whatever Subjects they are learning, add entiries and track their progress. It is fully user friendly as a user can add, delete or edit entries at any time. This way, a user is not obliged to buy a product but can use this section as an added incentive.

<h3>Blog</h3>
Everyone comes across articles and blogs everyday whether conciously or otherwise. Here, the Blog section features various areas of life as well as Topics that people love to talk about. Various publishers can come in and write on any Topics then publish for all users to view, and comment. he comment section gives power to the users to interact and share their views about whatever has been published.
This way, more ideas are are collected, mistakes corrected and weak ones amplified.
